# Plant-Disease-Detection
Agriculture is one of the main factors, that decides the growth of any country. Agriculture plays an important role because of the rapid growth of the population and the increased demand for food. Due to various seasonal conditions, the crops get infected by various kinds of diseases. Health monitoring and disease detection on the plant is very critical for sustainable agriculture. It is very difficult to monitor plant diseases manually. It requires a tremendous amount of work, expertise in plant diseases. In this project, we have proposed a technique that will detect the disease of plants and will also predict the medicine. This technique is named as plant disease detection application (PDDA) that will be developed in Python language using different algorithms. The user will capture the plant’s leaf image and detect its condition by using this application. If its condition is healthy, it will inform us that it’s a healthy plant but if it detects any defect or disease from the leaf it will inform us about the disease and relevant medicines and precautionary measures. PDDA involves steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. First, the user will select the leaf image from his system storage, then PDDA will run the process and passes these steps to detect its condition and show the results.
There will be provided a video and documentation for new users that will help them to use PDDA for the first time. PDDA will surely help the farmers to detect plant diseases accurately and take precautionary measures accordingly in less time and cost.

This application is developed using python and image processing techniques. Its GUI is designed using HTML, CSS and python will be used to design algorithms and for other functionalities.

**Languages:**

•	Python
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	Bootstrap


**How It Works?**

As we have designed GUI part of this project yet. Proper integration and algorithms will be done later. 
Plant-Disease-Detection contains four main directories at this time.
1.	mypdda
In this directory, there will be files with the name of views. In this file all html files are rendered. Other files will be managed accordingly i.e urls file is to manage urls with the main url file.
2.	PDDA
This is the main directory of the project where all settings and urls will be managed.
3.	Templates
In this directory, all HTML files are placed and rendered in views file.
Following files are placed in this directory
•	home.html
•	results.html
•	SavedResults.html
•	gallery.html
•	Diseases.html
•	About.html
•	Help.html
4.	Static
In this directory, all CSS files, java files, and assets/images are placed. These are accessed in HTML files.  

**Databases:**

SQLlite3:
SQLite3 is a very easy to use database engine. It is self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration and transactional. It is very fast and lightweight, and the entire database is stored in a single disk file. ... The Python Standard Library includes a module called "sqlite3" intended for working with this database.
For now, sqllite3 database is used that is provided by python.
Databasetables:
Three tables are created in python. We have just created tables and data is not placed there as we have dataset for different plants. Dataset contains multiple images and needs more space. So we will manage later.
Dataset:
We have gathered datasets for different plants and these datasets can not be placed in the repositor.


**How To Run Using CMD?**

•	Open command prompt.
•	Go to directory where you saved the project
•	Write the following commands to run this project
o	cd Plant-Disease-Detection
o	python manage.py runserver 



**Softwares:**

•	Python (Need to download and install in the system)
•	Django Framework (Need to install in your project)
•	Code editor (Pycharm, Sublime, Atom, Vs) any editor can be used.
